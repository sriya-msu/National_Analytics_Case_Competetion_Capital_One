Payment Default Detection:

**About the Project**
The Payment Default Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict payment defaults and mitigate financial risks involved.

### This project involved the following tasks:

* Performed exploratory data analysis on payments data from excel.
* Utilized Power BI for data visualization.
* Preprocessed the data to prepare it for model training.
* Trained a LightGBM (LGBM) model.
* Achieved over 80% accuracy in the model's predictions.
* Obtained a high AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) score.
* Employed various techniques, including feature engineering, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning, to improve model performance.
**Note: Various other models, techniques and visualizations have been iteratively implemented and evaluated to get best AUROC and are not included in the code base**
